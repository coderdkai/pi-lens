/**
 * Typed bounded telemetry emission (#1743).
 *
 * Four PRs in two days hand-built the same machinery: a failure path that
 * needs a detailed `latency.log` record, an exact per-identity tally, and a
 * bound so a storming subsystem cannot flood the log. #1705 (orphan
 * forensics), #1717 (pull timeouts and late answers), #1726 (navRequest
 * timeouts, rising edge per method and file), and #1733 (loop-block floor
 * with a per-turn bound) each rebuilt it, and each needed a review round to
 * get the bounding right. This module is the intersection of those four, not
 * a speculative framework. Three of its four options come straight from those
 * sites. The fourth, `capPerTurn`, expresses #1733's per-turn bound
 * structurally but has no caller yet: that site's bound is its call cadence,
 * and pinning a cap there would red its own wiring tests. It ships tested and
 * mutation-proofed, awaiting its first site.
 *
 * Three rules the helper makes structural instead of prose:
 *
 * 1. **The rising edge comes from the ledger's own tally.** #1705 established
 *    that `incrementDegradationCount` already knows whether a
 *    (kind, subject) pair is being seen for the first time, and returns it.
 *    A caller that wants "log the detail once, count the rest" reads that
 *    return value. It never keeps a second `Set` — a parallel latch is state
 *    that must re-arm at `session_start` and will eventually be forgotten
 *    (the #1266–#1625 defect class).
 * 2. **A per-turn cap names its turn.** `capPerTurn` carries the caller's
 *    `turnIndex` in the same object as the limit, so there is no separate
 *    reset to wire and forget: the counters clear when the observed turn
 *    changes. This is the same lazy clear-on-transition shape as
 *    `noteImportResolutionMemoTurn` (`clients/blocker-freshness.ts`).
 * 3. **Identity always survives.** Every emitted record carries the
 *    discriminating identity in `filePath` and in `metadata.identity`, so
 *    aggregation can still answer "which file, which method, which record is
 *    stuck" (the rule AGENTS.md states, now enforced by the signature).
 *
 * `BOUNDED_TELEMETRY_PHASES` is the registry.
 * `tests/clients/bounded-telemetry-sweep.test.ts` sweeps it registered-or-
 * fail: a failure-path phase must either route through this helper or carry a
 * stated reason for staying raw.
 *
 * Nothing here ever throws. Telemetry must not perturb the path it observes —
 * every one of the four migrated sites had already decided its outcome before
 * calling in.
