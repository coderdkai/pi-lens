/**
 * Label-gated merge lane (#2185).
 *
 * The review policy is unchanged and NOT automated here: every PR still gets
 * an adversarial review and a same-reviewer verify before anything merges.
 * Only the maintainer applies `train:approved`, so the label IS the review
 * verdict, and this lane only performs the mechanical last step the
 * orchestrating session used to babysit with a polling loop.
 *
 * What the polling loop kept getting wrong, and what this lane fixes:
 *
 * - A fixed timeout expiring silently read as "still pending", forever.
 * - A starved or absent CI run (#2184) also read as "still pending", forever.
 * - A DIRTY PR silently SKIPS its required checks, so "not failing" is not
 *   "passing" (AGENTS.md shape 11).
 *
 * The gate answers those by requiring positive evidence on the EXACT current
 * head: both required checks present, COMPLETED, and SUCCESS, plus a healthy
 * run classification. Everything else is not-green. That single rule is also
 * what re-gates a fix round: a new head has no concluded checks yet, so the
 * label survives and the merge waits without any stored "approved at SHA"
 * state to drift.
