/**
 * #1651 — the lifecycle-smoke lane's phase 5 pinned outcome "missing" for a
 * genuinely-absent `gh` binary, and passed on Windows but got "non-installable"
 * on Linux CI. Root cause: Node's own docs say the 'error' and 'close' event
 * ORDER for a child that never started (ENOENT) is unspecified — "the 'exit'
 * event may or may not fire after an error has occurred" — and Linux's real
 * shape closes a never-started child with `code = -errno` (e.g. `-2` for
 * ENOENT, `-4058` on Windows), never `null`.
 *
 * Round 1 of this fix re-checked an identity flag after a single microtask
 * `await` — a same-microtask guard that still loses when 'error' lands a
 * TICK later (`setImmediate`/`process.nextTick`), and pinned a `close(null,
 * null)` shape production never actually produces. Review round 2 (F2/F3)
 * moved the fix to be SHAPE-based instead of timing-based: `close`'s own
 * handler now decides straight from `code === null || code < 0` — a
 * completed process never exits with either — independent of whether/when
 * 'error' ever fires. F4 additionally requires this NOT invert a healthy
 * run: a `close(0, null)` followed by a late, unrelated 'error' (e.g. a
 * post-exit `kill()` failing with EPERM) must stay a clean success, never
 * get downgraded.
 *
 * Windows rarely hits the missing-tool race at all: `resolveWindowsCommand`
 * fails closed on an unresolvable bare command BEFORE any real `spawn()`
 * call, synthesizing a clean ENOENT deterministically. Linux (and any
 * Windows command that resolves but is later removed) always goes through
 * the raw event path — these tests mock `spawn()` directly so every shape
 * reproduces regardless of which platform runs the suite.
